# InsecureRandom

[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/insecure_random)](http://rubygems.org/gems/insecure_random)
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/laserlemon/insecure_random/rake.yml)](https://github.com/laserlemon/insecure_random/actions/workflows/rake.yml)

InsecureRandom hooks into SecureRandom to enable predictability via seeding.

## Why?

### RSpec

RSpec has a fantastic feature that allows you to run your tests in random order.

```bash
rspec --order=random
```

Running tests in random order helps you find potential ordering dependencies in
your test suite. For example, Test A and Test B both pass when run in that
order, but Test A fails if Test B runs first.

**Your test suite should not depend on the order in which the tests are run.**

If an ordering dependency causes a test failure, you can rerun the tests in the
same order using the seed from the previous run.

```bash
rspec --seed=93487
```

RSpec does this by seeding and using `Kernel.rand` to order your specs. This has
the handy side effect of making other random test data reproducible as well. For
example, your Factory Bot factories might use random data via Faker.

```ruby
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :user do
    name { Faker::Name.name }
    age { rand(100) }
  end
end
```

Since Faker uses `Kernel.rand` under the hood, your test data will be consistent
across seeded RSpec runs.

### SecureRandom

But what happens when generating random data isn't confined to your test suite?

Sometimes, it's necessary to generate random values for UUIDs, API keys, URL
slugs, etc. The `SecureRandom` module is perfect for those situations.
SecureRandom uses secure pseudorandom generators from tried and tested libraries
such as OpenSSL.

### The Problem

The problem with testing code that involves SecureRandom is that SecureRandom
isn't seedable, which means that RSpec isn't able to rerun your tests in a
predictable way.

### The Solution

Fortunately, SecureRandom only defines a handful of methods so it's relatively
easy to override them to be backed by `Kernel.rand`.

And it gets even better. All of SecureRandom's methods are derived from just
one method: `SecureRandom.gen_random`. So overriding that one method does the
trick!

```ruby
Kernel.srand(123)
SecureRandom.alphanumeric # => "kMupcJV93fBPd34p"
SecureRandom.alphanumeric # => "WTiAHSCC3JeqYAdJ"
Kernel.srand(123)
SecureRandom.alphanumeric # => "jID3bLAGYx2FHi27"

InsecureRandom.enable!

Kernel.srand(123)
SecureRandom.alphanumeric # => "2YmG5zns39eGRfKQ"
SecureRandom.alphanumeric # => "c58d341u4OJzkTyD"
Kernel.srand(123)
SecureRandom.alphanumeric # => "2YmG5zns39eGRfKQ"
```

## Installation

Add InsecureRandom to your Gemfile's test group:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem "insecure_random"
end
```

## Usage

As of InsecureRandom 2.0, SecureRandom's behavior remains entirely unchanged
until you explicitly enable InsecureRandom by adding the following to your
test/spec helper:

```ruby
InsecureRandom.enable!
```

The `enable!` method globally enables repeatable results from SecureRandom via
`Kernel.srand` seeding and can be disabled again with `InsecureRandom.disable!`.

You may also use the `enable` method to _temporarily_ enable SecureRandom
repeatability, only during execution of the given block. For example, RSpec
can be configured to enable InsecureRandom for each individual example:

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.around(:example) do |example|
    InsecureRandom.enable do
      example.run
    end
  end
end
```

:star: InsecureRandom does not change SecureRandom's behavior until either the
`InsecureRandom.enable!` or `InsecureRandom.enable` method is explicitly called.
That saidâ€¦
